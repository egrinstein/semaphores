## About
This project was developed for INF1019 (Computer Systems), a class held at PUC-Rio, Brazil.

We implement 2 communication channels: a syncronous, which holds a buffer containing a single integer,
and an assyncronous, containing a vector of integers.

With it, threads are able to communicate without data corruption/loss.
